Model Comparison:
We evaluated four different machine learning models to predict CPU burst times:


Linear Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
XGBoost


Performance Metrics:
We used three main metrics to evaluate the models:


Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
R2 Score: Indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable predictable from the independent variable(s).
Cross-Validation (CV) R2 Score: Provides a more robust estimate of model performance by testing on multiple subsets of the data.


Best Model Selection:
Linear Regression was selected as the best model based on its cross-validated R2 score (0.7625). This suggests it generalizes well to unseen data.
Feature Importance Analysis:
We conducted feature importance analysis using three methods:


Linear Regression coefficients
Random Forest built-in feature importance
Permutation importance for Random Forest


Key Findings:


The average of previous bursts (avg_previous_bursts) is consistently the most important feature across all models.
Process type importance varies between Linear Regression and Random Forest models.
System load and time of day are generally important features.
Memory usage and I/O operations have surprisingly low importance in predicting CPU burst times.


Implications:
These results provide insights into which factors most strongly influence CPU burst times in your simulated operating system. This information can be valuable for optimizing scheduling algorithms and understanding system behavior.
