# This is a placeholder script for collecting CFS scheduling data
# You'll need to implement the actual data collection logic based on your system and requirements

echo "Starting CFS data collection..."

# Example: Use perf to collect scheduling events
sudo perf record -e 'sched:sched_switch' -a sleep 60

echo "Data collection complete. Raw data saved."

# Note: You'll need to process this raw data into a format similar to your simulated data
# Use the process_cfs_data.py script for this purpose
